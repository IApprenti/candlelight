# candelight

Contains helpers for computer vision and natural language processing.

Based on PyTorch and Numpy.

## Intent

I'm creating this package to handle base structures and helpers I'm using between different projects. It is a work in progress and shall be filled over the next months and years.

## Disclaimer

Use with caution as this not a stable release. I suggest that you copy past code that is of interest for you in your project for now.
